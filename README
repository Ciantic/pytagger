PyID3v2 - Python ID3 Module
---------------------------

PyID3v2 is a ID3[1] tag reader and writer implemented purely in
Python. It supports all the current ID3 tag implementations including
ID3v1, ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4.

The motivation to write this was based on the fact that every
encoder/player used different sets of tags and encoded them
differently. Normally this isn't a problem except when it comes to
non-English character sets, like Chinese, there is a lot of confusion
out there. So in a bid to translate all my Big-5 encoded tags to
UTF-16 (for iTunes) or UTF-8 (for Rhythmbox), I wrote this module.

Note: I am aware there are several different Python ID3 modules. This
is the only one I'm aware of that supported ID3v2 without relying on
an external library. Others that support ID3v2 don't support
editing. I've had to rename my project specifically to not cause
confusion with existing pyid3 projects.

Status
------

The module is currently had the follow features:

- Reads ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 using the pyid3.ID3v1 class
- Reads ID3v2.2 to ID3v2.4 using the pyid3.ID3v2 class
 * Decodes all text, url, comments, attachments frames
- Write to ID3v2.2 to ID3v2.4 frames
- Able to add ID3 tags from scratch to existing MP3s
- Only works on MP3s

Examples
--------

Included are a couple of example scripts that I wrote to convert my
MP3 collection.

mp3check.py - Checks MP3s for ID3v2 and ID3v1 tags
mp3conv.py  - Converts MP3 tags from one encoding to another,
			  also attempts to fill in missing ID3v2 tags with
			  information from ID3v1 tags, if they exists
mp3stat.py  - Polls recursively a directory and outputs a list of
			  statistics about the files, including what version of
			  ID3v2 tags are in use and what frame types are present

Quirks
------
  iTunes
  ------
  * iTunes uses SyncSafe encoding for the length/size field in the ID3v2
    Header, but doesn't use it for the ID3v2 Frame Headers.

  libid3tag
  ---------
  * There seems to be a bug with libid3tag not setting the Restrictions
    bit in the ID3v2.4 Extensions Header, but attaching an extra byte
	for the field.

  * Even when setting Unicode encoding, libid3tag does not set the
    encoding value for each text field to anything non-zero.


Todo List
---------

If you are interested in helping out, please check out this list and
send me patches :)

 * Documentation !!
 * Split classes into their own files.
 * FIX FIXMEs, especially regarding missing frame encoders/decoders
 * Properly use flags in ID3v2
 * Implement write feature for ID3v1
 * Strict checking for fields in ID3v2
 * Able to cross convert ID3 tags between 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
 * Able to synchronise with ID3v1 tags (can be done externally)
